        <h1>I Am Truly Sorry</h1>
        <p>
            My love,<br><br>
            I need to sincerely apologize for what I said. 
            Saying that I would hurt you was completely wrong. 
            No matter how angry or emotional I was, you never deserved words like that.
            <br><br>
            I understand if you felt scared or hurt. 
            I take full responsibility for my behavior. 
            I promise you that I will never speak to you like that again.
            <br><br>
            You are someone I care about deeply, and the last thing I ever want 
            is to make you feel unsafe around me.
            <br><br>
            I am ready to change, to control my anger, and to be a better person for us.
            Please forgive me when you feel ready.
        </p>
